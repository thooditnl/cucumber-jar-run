Feature: I need a stack!
  As a noob
  I need to be able to store stuff in a stack
  So that I can demonstrate awesome things in a stack
  So that I can make more money!

Scenario: Push an item into a stack
  Given an empty stack
  When I push an item into the stack
  Then the stack contains one item

Scenario: Push two items into a stack
  Given an empty stack
  When I push an item into the stack
  And I push another item into the stack
  Then the stack contains two items

Scenario: Pop a given item from the stack
  Given an empty stack
  When I push an item into the stack
  And I pop from the stack
  Then I get the same item back
